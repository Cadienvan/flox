## Release Notes

The release notes workflow should follow:

- every commit gets a commit message
- when we're ready to cut a release, aggregate the features worked on based on the commits into a few bullets
- craft a release note with
    - summary paragraph
    - feature bullets
- commit them to this folder
- rebase and merge flox/flox-private into flox/flox
