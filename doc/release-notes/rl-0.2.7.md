## Release 0.2.7 (2023-08-17)

This release includes several improvements, bug fixes and feature refinements based on feedback from our 
users, including:
- Fixed several bugs related to parsing flake references.
- Made improvements for faster build times.
- Enabled users to build flox from source.
- Added `flox uninstall` command (which will eventually replace the `flox remove` command).
- Updated the `flox publish` command to require fewer arguments, utilise a config file and help simplify publishing 
  a package to a catalog.
- Removed unecessary output for `flox search`.
- Updated documentation and manpages to reflect recent changes.

We especially want to thank all our github.com/flox/flox contributors and discourse community members for all your valuable 
feedback!
